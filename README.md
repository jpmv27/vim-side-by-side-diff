Vim plugin to display diff files as side-by-side diffs

Based on <https://brookhong.github.io/2016/09/03/view-diff-file-side-by-side-in-vim.html>

Still in development, expect non-backward compatible changes at any time.

Browse the source for more information, docs to come later.

TLDR: Use the command `:SideBySide` for each diff file you open in vim
